The Music Alarm project uses the Sleep SDK to wake you up when you are in light sleep with a song from your iTunes library. If you are listening to music when going to bed, the Sleep SDK will also automatically turn it off once you fall asleep.

Once you have downloaded an example project, make sure to download the most recent version of the Sleep SDK from the Misfit Developer Portal and add it to the project.
